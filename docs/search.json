    "text": "Welcome to the companion documentation for the Transferable Neural Network Pipeline for Fair Prediction Using Group-Specific Gating.\nThis project presents a modular neural network pipeline designed to support fair prediction across protected subgroups, using gated subgroup-specific components. The current implementation uses the GENDEP dataset as a proof-of-concept, but all scripts and methods are written to be generalisable.\n\n0.0.1 🧭 Contents\n\n📄 Overview – purpose, motivation, pipeline diagram\n🧹 Data Preprocessing – required structure and cleaning steps\n🔧 Feature Engineering – normalisation, subgroup definitions\n🧠 Model Definition – gated neural net architecture\n🏋️ Training – procedure, cross-validation, fairness constraints\n📊 Evaluation – performance metrics and subgroup analyses\n🧪 GENDEP Example – demo use case\n📚 For Reviewers – BMC Bioinformatics summary and context\n📖 References\n\n\n\n🔍 This site is designed for researchers, developers, and reviewers interested in reproducible, fairness-aware machine learning pipelines.
