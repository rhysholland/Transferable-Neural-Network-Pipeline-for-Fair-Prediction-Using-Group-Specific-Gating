Welcome to the companion documentation for the **Transferable Neural Network Pipeline for Fair Prediction Using Group-Specific Gating**.

This project presents a modular neural network pipeline designed to support *fair prediction across protected subgroups*, using **gated subgroup-specific components**. The current implementation uses the **GENDEP dataset** as a proof-of-concept, but all scripts and methods are written to be generalisable.
